## Instructions

For this lab, you will create a Rails application that models a record store with albums. There is a required section and an optional bonus section for this lab. 


### Required 

1. Create a Rails app with a model named `Album` and the following attributes: `title`, `artist`, `year`. 

2. Confirm that your application adheres to the basic principles of MVC (Model, View, Controller) and RESTful design. Everything we've been doing up to this point! 

3. Include and require the Bootstrap CDN in your vendor assets and style your page using Bootstrap. 

### BONUS
4. Create another model named `Song` and associate it with an album. Associations were mentioned in the Rails Guide tutorial for creating a blogging application. If you have forgotten how associations work, please refer to the [Rails Guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#associating-models).
